Here are stored some scripts i made during my studies. 

# Modelisation

**Delft3D_Quicktools** contains scripts i created to use Delft3D

**XB_toolbox** contains scripts i used during my internship to create XBeach simulations. They aren't too evolved but they work. 

**SWAN_toolbox** is a quick toolbox to create simple SWAN simulations

# Fieldwork

**Instruments** contains some tools to read, clean, and analyse field data from pressure and current meters with FFT, timeseries, ...

**TDV_topo** contains some tools to postprocess topographic data from EMLID GNSS and Deeper echosounders I worked with in my second MSC year internship.
